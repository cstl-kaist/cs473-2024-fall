## Problem Statement
Students in dormitories struggle to find handed-out or sharable items, leading to unnecessary purchases.

## Problem Background
From our experiences, freshmen and exchange students often face financial pressure when buying new items for campus, while many students moving out throw away perfectly good, reusable items. Although donation boxes exist, they are scattered and lack visibility, and students often struggle to find someone to exchange items with, leading to unnecessary purchases. Similarly, other universities have addressed this issue by encouraging students to use messaging apps to exchange second-hand items, creating a more affordable campus experience [1]. Some universities also organize offline exchange events, though these happen less than twice a year [2]. This problem is important because it reduces resource waste by reusing otherwise discarded items and financial pressure on students by promoting sharing among students, thereby fostering sustainability and easing mental stress associated with unnecessary purchases.

## Motivation
This is a social computing problem because the core of our solution involves students sharing information through a custom-designed online platform, creating a demand-supply cycle. Simply designating a physical location for donations would not work as effectively—it would be less organized, require more space, and limit visibility. Also, offline communication reaches a smaller group, making it harder for students to find what they need when they need it. By leveraging a digital platform that connects students, we can reach more students in a more efficient and structured way.
