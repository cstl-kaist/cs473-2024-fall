# Problem Statement

Collaboration is crucial in choreography, but since the methods of collaboration are unstructured, there is a lot of inefficiency in communication.

# Problem Background

The paper “Diversity’s Harvest: Interactions of Diversity Sources and Communication Technology on Creative Group Performance” by Giambatista and Bhappu (2010) demonstrates that communication methods significantly impact group performance. By comparing computer-mediated communication (CMC) and face-to-face (FTF) communication, the study found that CMC is particularly effective for improving performance in diverse groups. FTF communication, while rich in cues, can sometimes hinder efficiency by confusing participants. Interviews with professionals and school club members revealed dissatisfaction with current communication practices in choreography. Inefficient communication leads to wasted resources, poor performance quality, and team discord, making the need for better collaboration methods crucial.

# Motivation

Group choreography requires a unified performance, but face-to-face (FTF) communication often introduces issues like unconscious biases, instant reactions, or categorization that hinder effective collaboration. Research suggests that creative ideas can be stifled by immediate skepticism, further complicating communication. While a communication expert might mitigate some of these challenges, their lack of expertise in choreography limits their effectiveness in this context. Therefore, we conclude that social computing is the best-fit solution for addressing communication inefficiencies in choreography, as it enables structured yet flexible collaboration, allowing ideas to flow freely without the hindrances of FTF interaction.

# **Solution Ideas**

Colored solutions are the ones that have finally been selected.

### 1. HMW make it easier for performers to quickly share feedback efficiently?

1. **Directors can accumulate feedback** and deliver them to the performer so that there are **no** **overlapping feedback.**
2. Give **incentive** or status for **fast-responding or quality feedback.**
3. Provide a way to leave **timestamped notes or video comments** during rehearsals, allowing **instant feedback on specific moments** in the choreography.
4. Create bulletin board that everyone can **suggest their idea or feedback** and **start a conversation thread** for any idea.
5. **Modulize** each dance movement or route and create a **flow chart** of choreography for each member. It can also be **modified simultaneously by multiple members**.
6. Add **direct message function** to talk closely about idea with a certain member.
7. Create **templates** to help directors give **clear, useful feedback on timing, expression, and technique**, making sure the feedback is short and effective.

### 2. HMW help dancers and choreographers to easily **keep track and manage changes** in choreography over time.

1. Create a digital tool that **saves each change** in the choreography, so dancers can **track and go back to earlier versions** if needed.
2. **Update changes** to a platform that can be **accessible to both choreographers and dancers.**
3. Allow the director to **collect feedback and idea suggestions regularly** and members to **check it on one site**.
4. Specify **previous conversations or references** for **new idea suggestions or conversations**.
5. Design a **visual timeline** that shows how the choreography develops, with options to add notes on **important changes and decisions** during rehearsals. This makes it **easier to follow the creative process**.

### 3. HMW ensure that all members have a **clear understanding** of the choreography **vision and goals**?

1. Make a **shared digital mood board** with visual and audio references that show the vision and goals, so **all members can access** it.
2. Create a place to **freely ask questions** to the directors.
3. At the start of rehearsals, give a **detailed project brief** with key goals, vision, and style choices.
4. **Share updates on a cloud platform** so everyone can **check and stay aligned** during the process.
5. Have **director-centric sessions** so that performers can be given **clear and unified directions**.
6. Show everyone or the director **who did not check** his/her must-see resources.

## 3 Selected Solutions

1. Provide a way to leave **timestamped notes** or **video comments** during rehearsals, allowing **instant feedback on specific moments** in the choreography.
2. Create **templates** to help performers give **clear, useful feedback on timing, expression, and technique**, making sure the feedback is short and effective.
3. Create a digital tool that **saves each change** in the choreography, so dancers can **track and go back to earlier versions** if needed.
